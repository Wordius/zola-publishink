The world has changed since I started out in publishing – back in 1985, to be exact. But throughout that time, I’ve been fortunate enough to live my dream working as a journalist and helping clients along the way.

That dream led me down a varied path. I’ve been a designer, journalist, editor, publisher, website creator, and even a ‘chief speed tester’. Since going freelance in 2002, I’ve enjoyed working with a broad range of clients, including the Invest in Britain Bureau (then part of the DTI), Pira, Bauer Media, Haymarket Publications, Beyond Behaviour, Euromoney, Mark Allen Publishing, Octane Media, Kelsey Media, Bennetts Insurance – and, yes, even Tony the electrician.

Of all the titles I’ve worked on, _Bike_ magazine stands out. It gave me the most joy, the chance to travel, and the opportunity to meet some remarkable people. Highlights included snowmobiling in Revelstoke, Canada; testing Suzuki’s V-Strom at its launch in Cape Town; and (disastrously) trying to ride the European champion’s funny bike at Shakespeare County Raceway in Warwickshire.

These days, I’m the editor of _DogFriendly_ magazine, which caters to people who love travelling with their dogs. I also built [Nopy](https://nopy.co.uk/), a website for a local pylon protest group, and when I’m not writing, you’ll likely find me gardening.

I’m also a keen [watch collector](https://wordius.com/journal/watches/), enjoy writing in Markdown, and I love typography, the art of arranging type.
