A short list:

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), my writing tool of choice.
- The creator of [Zola](https://getzola.org), Jeremy Prouillet, for the framework I used to build this site. 
- The many digital gardens out there, including [ovi.design](https://www.ovl.design/) by Oscar and Jacob Leechâ€™s [Digital Craftsman](https://jacobleech.com/).
- Fonts are IM Fell (available on Google Fonts) and Fontin, by Jos Buivenga at [Exljbris](https://www.exljbris.com).

I will update this list as time goes on.
