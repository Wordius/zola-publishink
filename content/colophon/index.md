A short list:

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), my writing tool of choice.
- [Zola](https://getzola.org), the static site generator I used to build this site. Content is written in [Commonmark](https://commonmark.org), a specification of Markdown. 
- The many fine websites out there, including those by [Jacob Leech](https://jacobleech.com/), [Mike Mai](https://mikemai.net) and [Gwern Branwen](https://gwern.net). The latter simply because I love the typography and density of the website.
- Fonts are IM Fell (available from Google Fonts) and Fontin Sans, which you’re reading now, by Jos Buivenga at [Exljbris](https://www.exljbris.com). I love IM Fell’s rough, aged look; it is reminiscent of type you see on well-thumbed, printed page. 

I will update this list as time goes on.
