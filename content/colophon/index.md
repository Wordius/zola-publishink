A short list:

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), my writing tool of choice.
- The creator of [Zola](https://getzola.org), Jeremy Prouillet, for the application I used to build this site. 
- The many fine websites out there, including those by Jacob Leech ([Digital Craftsman](https://jacobleech.com/)), [Mike Mai](https://mikemai.net) and [Jason Santa Maria](https://www.jasonsantamaria.com).
- Fonts are IM Fell (available from Google Fonts) and Fontin Sans, which youâ€™re reading now, by Jos Buivenga at [Exljbris](https://www.exljbris.com).

I will update this list as time goes on.
