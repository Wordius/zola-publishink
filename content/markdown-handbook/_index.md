Markdown is a lightweight mark-up language. It is used by writers, bloggers, mathematicians, scientists, project managers, task managers, and journal keepers.

In fact, if you have ever used WhatsApp or Slack messages, then you have used markdown. It’s uses are wide, and it is spreading. [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org), a free and private office suite of applications, has recently been adopted by the [Austrian military](https://www.archyde.com/microsoft-is-retired-bundesheer-changes-to-libreoffice-it-security/) to replace its reliance on Microsoft. LibreOffice has plans to [introduce markdown](https://news.itsfoss.com/libreoffice-markdown-support/).
Markdown is a simple way of formatting text. When you add bold, italics, numbered lists, bullet points, headings, and so on to text, you are formatting it. Markdown is a set of rules, or syntax, that formats text on web pages. 

To format text on web pages, people use Hypertext Markup Language, better known as HTML. But HTML can be complex, with numerous tags, such as `<div>`, `<menu>`, and `<uI>`. Computers have no trouble reading these because they follow the syntax, but the tags make it difficult for humans to read HTML, so it’s not user friendly.

Markdown was created by John Gruber and Aaron Schwartz in 2004. The original syntax for markdown is on Gruber’s website, [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

But, there’s more to markdown than HTML. With built-in parsers, or readers, it can be used generate stunning presentations (IA Presenter) and beautiful, readable documentation, fit to grace any boardroom.

### Why use markdown

There is no need to frequently reach for the mouse to format text, allowing you to maintain your train of thought. Writers can focus on creating content without being distracted by formatting issues. Compared to traditional WYSIWYG editors, such as Microsoft Word, Markdown enables you to:

- Keep both hands on the keyboard for higher input efficiency
- Quickly format with simple markup symbols
- Avoid complex menu operations and formatting settings.

### Less of a learning curve

Compared to markup languages, such as HTML, markdown syntax is simple, with most people able to master the basics in under an hour.

Common markup symbols are fewer than ten:

- `#` for headings
- `*` for emphasis or lists
- > for blockquotes or quotes
- `[]()` for links
- `![]()` for images.

### Compatibility

Most text editors, code editors, and note-taking apps support markdown. From simple notepads to professional writing tools, you can find markdown everywhere.
