No surprise, this list leans heavily towards Mac/iOS. Among these apps are some that work on other platforms, such as Windows and Linux.

My favourite markdown app at the moment is Obsidian. The app is served up as no-bones-about-it markdown editor and you learn how to extend it from there: as a journal, to manage tasks, and to write. Unlike Notion, for example, which loads all bells whistling and you are forced to pare it back to see what’s below the surface. This approach leads to confusion, in my view.
