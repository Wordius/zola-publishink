There are far too many flavours, or variants, of markdown to contemplate here. So I will only mention four:

- The original spec
- Multimarkdown
- Commonmark
- Github-flavoured markdown.

See [here](https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-spec/wiki/Markdown-Flavors) if you’re interested in finding out more, but note that many on this list are versions tailored to specific apps.

### Markdown – the original

Markdown became a thing back in 2004, when John Gruber and Aaron Schwartz wrote the first specification.

Put simply, markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool originally designed for web writers. It allows you to write in an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid HTML.

So, with that said, markdown is two things: 

1. a plain text formatting syntax; and
2. a software tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text formatting to HTML. See the [syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) page on John Gruber’s site for details.

Several variants have been developed since to enhance and adapt markdown to different platforms. Often these variants are referred to as _flavours_. Some of the main variants are Commonmark and GitHub flavored markdown, or GFM.

These variants modify the original standard set for markdown.

### MultiMarkdown

MultiMarkdown, mentioned here because it was one of the earliest variants, is an extension of markdown that adds a number of features to create more complex documents, such as academic papers and books. It was developed by Fletcher Penney.

The main features of MultiMarkdown are its support for metadata, footnotes and references, and mathematical formulas and equations.

### Commonmark

Commonmark is a markdown specification developed to address the lack of standardisation and consistency in existing markdown implementations. Its goal is to provide a unified and clear definition of the language, ensuring that content is interpreted consistently across different platforms and applications.

The main features of Commonmark are a detailed and standardised specification that defines how Markdown should behave in various situations, offering a a solid foundation for the development of additional extensions and variants and ensuring that content is displayed consistently across different implementations.

As a result, Commonmark allows the addition of extensions to cover additional functionalities without breaking the basic specification.

Commonmark is the specification used in Obsidian, my current notes app.

### GitHub flavored markdown, or GFM

GitHub-flavoured markdown is the variant that is used on GitHub to format README files, comments and other content. The main features of GFM, include the creation of tasks and checklists, tables and footnotes.
