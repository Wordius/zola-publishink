No legalese here. I am not a solicitor (read lawyer), nor am I involved in the legal profession in any other way. 

## Your data

I tried to avoid using any Javascript at all, but this site serves up one piece of JS from Usermaven. User data protection is ensured through Usermaven’s stringent, [privacy-first policies](https://usermaven.com/privacy). The company uses cookie-less tracking to prioritise user privacy.

## Web fonts

I use web fonts. All font files are served from this domain and there is no third party involved. If you have web fonts turned off, it does not load that stylesheet or the corresponding files, which should save you some bandwidth but not much. I think this site looks better with them, but you may see things differently.

## Links

You may occasionally come across links to Amazon and elsewhere. These may be affiliate links, they may not. Affiliate links help cover the costs of maintaining this site. Only help, mind you.

## Email

Emails are kept private, especially when sent encrypted, but I may want to quote something you have written on occasion. If that happens, I’ll ask you. If you have emailed me about something you think I got wrong, I will ask if it’s okay to use your name to credit the correction.

I take your privacy and confidentiality seriously. If you have any comments, see my [contact page](/contact) for how to get in touch.
