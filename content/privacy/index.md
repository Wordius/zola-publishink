No legalese here. I am not a solicitor (read lawyer), nor am I involved in the legal profession in any other way. 

### Your data

I tried to avoid using any Javascript at all, but this site serves up one piece of JS from Usermaven. User data protection is ensured through [Usermaven’s stringent, privacy-first policies](https://usermaven.com/privacy). 

### Web fonts

I use web fonts. All font files are served from this domain and there is no third party involved. If you have web fonts turned off, it does not load that stylesheet or the corresponding files, which should save you some bandwidth but not much. I think this site looks better with them, but you may see things differently.

### Links

You may occasionally come across links to Amazon. These may be affiliate links, they may not. All I can say is that I have to keep this blog paid for some how and Amazon’s model suited me at the time.

### Email

Emails are kept private, especially when sent encrypted, but I may want to quote something you have written on occasion. If that happens, I’ll ask you. If you have emailed me about something you think I got wrong, I will ask if it’s okay to use your name to credit the correction.

I accept comments via email only. 

I take your privacy and confidentiality seriously.

Please [email me](/contact) if you have any questions.
