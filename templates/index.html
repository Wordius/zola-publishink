        <p >Journalist, designer, editor and chief coffee maker, I was known as a few things in 20-plus years in publishing.</p>
        <p>Freelance since 2002, I have worked for <em>Corporate Location</em>, <em>MCN</em>, <em>Bike</em>, <em>RiDE</em>, <em>Golf World</em>, <em>Today’s Golfer</em>, <em>Octane</em>, <em>Classic Car</em>, <em>Wrights Farming Register</em>, and a few others that have since folded or disappeared from newsstands. I live and work in a sleepy Lincolnshire village that’s rudely awoken every year at harvest time.</p>
        <p>I am currently editor of <em>DogFriendly</em>, a magazine for people who like to travel with their dogs, and available for contract work.</p>        
        <p>For more, see my <a href="/about">about</a> page and for updates read <a href="/notes">notes</a> section, which is my blog. I don’t post often.</p>
