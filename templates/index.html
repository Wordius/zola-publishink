        <p>I have worked in publishing since 1985, living my dream as a journalist, editor, a publication designer and a web designer. Freelance since 2002, I have collaborated with clients ranging from Bauer Media and Haymarket to Euromoney, Bennetts Insurance, and Tony the electrician. I’ve written for many titles, but <em>Bike</em> magazine was a highlight, offering travel, adventure, and the occasional crash. I’m currently the editor of <em>DogFriendly</em> magazine, creator of various websites, a gardener, and Markdown enthusiast.</p>
