        <p >Journalist, designer, editor and chief speed tester, I was known as a few things in my 20-plus years in publishing.</p>
        <p>Freelance since 2002, I have worked on business and consumer magazines in the motorcycle, car and golf worlds, along with a few others that have since folded or disappeared from newsstands. I have also produced many books, including the <em>Print & Production Manual</em>. I live and work in a sleepy Lincolnshire village that’s rudely awoken every year at harvest time.</p>
        <p>I am currently editor of <em>DogFriendly</em>, a magazine for people who like to travel with their dogs.</p>        
        <p>For more, see my <a href="/about">about</a> page and for updates read the <a href="/notes">blog</a>. Don’t get too excited, I don’t post there often.</p>
